This is a guide to enable alsabat test for ddt

Basic Audio Tester (BAT) is a simple command line utility
intended to automate audio driver and sound server QA testing with no human
interaction. It is also intended for anyone developing audio driver or sound
server software or firmware under Linux.

BAT works by playing an audio stream and capturing the same stream in either a
digital or analog loop back, and then analyzes the captured data to determine
if the test case passes or fails.  BAT can also records and analyzes audio
stream that generated by a target device, and therefore no need to install and
run BAT on the target device.

1. alsabat test result will fail when the target machine sound card playback or
capture value is too high or too low, we should adjust the target machine
sound card playback and capture value by alsamixer
	- Use 'alsamixer -c 0' to adjust default sound card volume and sound
	  controls.
	- Use F3, F4 and F5 keys to switch to playback, capture and all view
	  mode, respectively.
	- Use Up and Down Arrows control the volume for the currently selected
	  device.
	- Use 'alsa store -f <filename>', store the current settings to a
	  configure file, and copy the configure file to
	  LKP_SRC/configs/alsabat folder.
	- Add the 'ALSA_CONFIGURATION_FILE=<filename>' to target
	  machine params file in params folder.

2. alsactl command is used to load the configuration file generated by
alsamixer. 'alsa.conf' is required when execute alsactl command, the path
alsactl try to find the alsa.conf is defined by
'--with-configdir=/usr/local/etc' in LKP_SRC/utils/audioutils/Makefile.
Please don't modify the value unless it's necessary.
If you want to modify the value, you should do follow steps:
	- Edit the LKP_SRC/utils/audioutils/Makefile, change
	  '--with-configdir=<driver_file_path>' value in 'alsa-lib'
	- Add the 'ALSA_DRIVER_FILE=<driver_file_path>' to target machine
	  params file in params folder.
