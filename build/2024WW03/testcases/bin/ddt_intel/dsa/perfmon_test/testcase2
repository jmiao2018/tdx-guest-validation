# Test event category 0x0 = 'WQ', test workload run multiple times

# To count total number of descriptor submissions using ENQCMD or
# ENQCMDS, software can use a single counter to aggregate counts of
# the following events in the WQ category

# event 0x1, EV_ENQ_SUCCESS_LIMPORTAL - Number of successful
# ENQCMD/ENQCMDS (NP writes) submitted to limited portal.

# event 0x4, EV_ENQ_SUCCESS_UNLIMPORTAL - Number of successful
# ENQCMD/ENQCMDS (NP writes) submitted to unlimited portal.

# event 0x10, EV_DWQ_SUCCESS - Number of successful posted
# writes to DWQ.

# All filters set to default value of 0xFF (no constraints).

# Setup:
#   assumes setup_dsa_dmatest_disabled has been run
