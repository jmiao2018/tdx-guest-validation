# Test event category = 'Engine', traffic class 1

# To count total number of memory accesses from engine 1, on TC 1,
# with transfer size 4KB or higher, software can use a combination of
# the following events in the Engine Event Category.
#
# event 0x4, EV_NUM_READ - Number of reads issued.
# event 0x8, EV_NUM_WRITE - Number of writes issued.
#
# Filters:
#
#   According to spec, only TC, SZ, and ENT filters apply to engine
#   category, but if other filters e.g. wq set incorrectly, they will
#   filter events out.
#
#   Also, current hw bug requires unused filters to be set to 0xff..
#
#   Set FLTCFG_WQ to 0x1 (Filter=WQ, Filter Value=0x1 i.e. WQ0)
#   Set FLTCFG_SZ to 0x3 (Filter=Transfer Size, Filter Value=0x3)
#     bit 0: size 0 - 512B
#     bit 1: size 512B - 2KB
#   Set FLTCFG_ENG to 0x1 (Filter=Engine, Filter Value=0x1 i.e. Eng0)
#   Set FLTCFG_TC to 0x2 (Filter=TC, Filter Value=0x2 i.e. TC1)
#   Set FLTCFG_PGSZ to 0x4 (Filter=PGSZ, Filter Value=0x7)
#     Currently this isn't supported in hw
#     bit 2: size 1G
#
# Setup:
#   assumes setup_dsa_dmatest_disabled has been run
