# The expectation is no crashes / warnings in the kernel and that
# group works well. For a group, the group member must be from the
# same PMU for the current perf. The number of member events must be
# less than the number of available counters.  Otherwise, perf tool
# should print warning or print <not counted> or <not supported>.
 
# For perf stat -e {dsa0/event0/,dsa2/event1} which members are from
# different PMU, you should expect the warning/<not counted> message
# from perf tool.

# note group event has to be on same PMU/device
#
# Setup:
#   assumes setup_dsa_dmatest_disabled has been run

# Some events weren't counted. Try disabling the NMI watchdog:
#        echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
#        perf stat ...
#        echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
# The events in group usually have to be from the same PMU. Try reorganizing the group.
