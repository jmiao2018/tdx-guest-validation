# Test event category = 'Address Translation', model-specific events

# To estimate frequency of occurrence of an event, software needs to
# use 2 distinct counters." "To estimate frequency (expressed as a
# percentage) of ATC full condition, software can program counter 0 to
# count EV_ATC_ALLOC events and counter 1 to count EV_ATC_NO_ALLOC
# events.
#
# event 0x40, ATC_ALLOC - Num translation requests to ATC
# event 0x80, ATC_NO_ALLOC - Num translation requests to ATC failed alloc
#
# Filters:
#
#   According to spec, only ENG filters apply to these events, but if
#   other filters e.g. wq set incorrectly, they will filter events
#   out.
#
#   These are a model-specific events.

# Setup:
#   assumes setup_dsa_dmatest_disabled has been run
