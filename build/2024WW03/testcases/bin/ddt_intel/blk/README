SD Test Cases

This file contains instructions how to set up the environment
and how to run SD Test Cases.


SET UP ENVIRONMENT
========================================================================================================

 1. Independently on what platform will be used, it needs to have an SD slot.

 2. SD Test Cases execute test for SD, SDHC and SDXC. So need to get either:
     - Prepare an SD at least 2GB and format it with at least one partition in 'vfat' FS, an SDHC at least
       16GB and format it in 'vfat' FS and an SDXC at least 64GB and format it in 'vfat' FS.
     - Prepare only an SDHC or SDXC at least 64GB and format it in 'vfat' FS.
    It is recommended the second option since the technology device between the memories are the same,
    the only differences is the speed and the storage capacity, but speed is not relevant for tests.

 3. Insert the SD into DUT's slot.

RUN TESTCASES
========================================================================================================

 1. Run "runandroid_build.sh --sdk 21 --platform $PLATFORM"
     - $PLATFORM
	* byt-cr-ecs (This the only one supported now)
  * byt-cr-ecs2_7b
	* byt-cr-ecs2_8a

 2. Run "runandroid_install.sh --tsid $TSID --platform $PLATFORM --sdk 21 --devid $DEV_ID --install"
     - $TSID
     	* ltp-ddt:        run all test scenario files defined in android-ddt-func-subset.
  	  * ltp-ddt-stress: run all test scenario files defined in android-ddt-stress-subset.
	    * ltp-ddt-perf:   run all test scenario files defined in android-ddt-perf-subset.
	    * ltp-ddt-full:   run all test scenario files defined in android-ddt-fullset.

     - $PLATFORM
	    * byt-cr-ecs (this the only one supported now)
	    * byt-cr-ecs2_7b
	    * byt-cr-ecs2_8a

     - $DEV_ID
	    * Device ID get with 'adb devices' command.

     - '--install' is optional, which is required the first time you run the test on DUT or there are
       some updates of test cases.
