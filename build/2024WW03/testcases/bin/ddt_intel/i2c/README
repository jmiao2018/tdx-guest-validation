I2C Test
--------
Targeted HW platforms:
 Broalwell-U
 Baytrail-T

Purpose:
 Basicly check I2C controller's driver and acpi enum. If there are I2C slave devices
 tests will validate I2C transfer by reading/writing slave devices.

Driver source:
 ${Linux-kernel-tree}/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-designware-platdrv.c (acpi enumeration)

Required Linux kernel config options:
 CONFIG_I2C_DESIGNWARE_PLATFORM (ACPI enumeration)
 CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV (i2c-dev test driver)

/!\ Use "make menuconfig" command to update Linux kernel config file and enable some potentially dependent options /!\

NOTE:
 We use i2ctools to test i2c. Please make sure CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV has been enabled.
 Before you launch the tests, please make sure i2c-dev module has been loaded. This
 module will create /sys/class/i2c-dev sysfs which is used for i2ctools.

Hardware dependencies:
 N/A

--------Please attention---------
We have no i2c slave devices connected to I2C controller. However, i915 driver has
used i2c algorithm driver to manager Display Monitor Connectors. We can test i2c
transfer function by reading/writing Display Monitor Connectors.

-If you want to test this, a Display Monitor have to be connected to you device
-If not, a BLOCK will be returned, and it is expected because I2C device has not
been registered if a Display Monitor has not been detected.
