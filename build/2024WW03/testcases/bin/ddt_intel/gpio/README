GPIO Test
--------
Targeted HW platforms:
 Broalwell-U
 Baytrail-T

Purpose:
 Mainly test sysfs interfaces of GPIO. To validate its basic functions like:
 direction setting, interrupt setting, troggle setting .e.g.

Driver source:
 They are hardware-specific, you may find Intel's at ${Linux-kernel-tree}/drivers/
pinctrl/intel/

Required Linux kernel config options:
 Options are hardware-specific, however, those options must be enabled:
 CONFIG_GPIOLIB=y
 CONFIG_GPIO_ACPI=y
 CONFIG_GPIO_SYSFS=y

/!\ Use "make menuconfig" command to update Linux kernel config file and enable some potentially dependent options /!\

NOTE:
 If CONFIG_GPIO_SYSFS is not enabled, there will be no sysfs nodes of GPIO under sysfs.

Hardware dependencies:
 byt-t-t100
